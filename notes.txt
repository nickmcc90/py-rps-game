First init

timestamp 39:50

The computer will keep score between the user and the computer.

1. We need one variable for the user, and for the computer score.
2. In a while True loop, we ask the person to select r,p, or s.
3. Make sure that their input is in .lower().
4. Have a condition that checks for if they want to quit. We can have a break statement after.
5. Condition for if they didn't type in r,p,s. We continue in the loop.
6. After these conditions, make a random number with randint(0,2)
7. This will be the computer move. R,p, and s are delegated to their own number.
8. Store the r,p,s moves in a list called options before the while loop.
9. With the random number, we can have the computer select from this list.
10. Now, we check the different WINNING situations.
11. If we didn't win, we can have an else statment for the computer.
12. We don't need continues for these statements because the while loop will keep running until
the user quits.
13. We print the user wins and the computer wins at the end of the loop.
14. There is the end!
